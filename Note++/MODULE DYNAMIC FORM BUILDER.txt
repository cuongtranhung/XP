  | Component                 | Confidence | Reason                                           |
  |---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | Database Design           | 95%        | Well-defined requirements, proven patterns       |
  | Authentication            | 90%        | Standard implementation, existing libraries      |
  | Form Builder UI           | 75%        | Complex drag-and-drop, UX challenges             |
  | Security Implementation   | 70%        | Compliance requirements, unknown vulnerabilities |
  | File Upload System        | 80%        | Security scanning complexity                     |
  | Microservices Integration | 75%        | Service communication complexity                 |
  | Performance Optimization  | 70%        | Unknown bottlenecks, scaling challenges          |

  Validation Methods Used

  1. Historical Data: Similar project experiences
  2. Expert Judgment: Senior developer estimates
  3. Analogous Estimation: Comparable system analysis
  4. Work Breakdown: Detailed task decomposition
  5. Risk Analysis: Monte Carlo simulation
  6. Cross-validation: Multiple estimation approaches

  Recommendation

  Recommended Approach: Proceed with 18-week timeline and $450K budget

  Key Success Factors:
  - Experienced team with relevant skills
  - Clear requirements and minimal scope changes
  - Regular security reviews and testing
  - Parallel development streams where possible
  - Adequate risk buffers for complex components

  Critical Decision Points:
  - Week 4: Architecture validation and performance testing
  - Week 8: Security framework validation
  - Week 12: Integration testing and performance validation
  - Week 16: Production readiness assessment

  This estimation provides a comprehensive analysis with appropriate risk buffers and confidence intervals to ensure
  successful project delivery within the expected timeline and budget constraints.
