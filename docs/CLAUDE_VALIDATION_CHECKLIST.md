## üìû ESCALATION GUIDE

### When to Request Human Review:

1. **Major Changes**: Structural reorganization, new categories
2. **Security Concerns**: Documenting auth, encryption, vulnerabilities  
3. **Architecture Decisions**: System design, technology choices
4. **Public-Facing**: User guides, API documentation for external use
5. **Uncertainty**: Any doubt about approach or content

### How to Mark for Review:
```yaml
---
status: review_required
review_notes: |
  - Concern about security implications
  - Need confirmation on API design
  - Unsure about example appropriateness
---
```
